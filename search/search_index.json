Since the option to create a custom report is currently unavailable in the New Analyzer UX, we will be using our current Analyzer interface for this lab.</p> <p>In Webex Contact Center, there are four primary data repositories that store critical customer and agent-related information. These repositories are structured as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Customer Activity Record</p> </li> <li> <p>Description: This type of record represents individual, atomic steps within the customer's workflow. It captures key moments in the customer journey, providing insights into their interactions with the contact center.</p> </li> <li> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Customer in IVR or queue, talking to an agent, or on hold.</li> <li>Customer on specific web pages, such as the home page, product page, or checkout page.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Customer Session Record</p> </li> <li> <p>Description: Customer Session Records are more comprehensive, encapsulating the entire customer workflow. They consist of a sequence of customer activities, providing a holistic view of the customer's engagement with the contact center.</p> </li> <li> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Customer calls the contact center for assistance.</li> <li>Customer visits a website and explores its content.</li> <li>Customer interacts with the website and engages in a chat with an agent.</li> <li>Customer initiates contact by sending an email, and an agent responds.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Agent Activity Record</p> </li> </ol> <p>Description: This record type focuses on individual actions within the agent's workflow. It logs every significant step an agent takes, shedding light on their interactions and status throughout their workday.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>Agent's status transitions, such as idle, available, talking, or wrapping up.</li> <li>Agent's offline activities, including dialing, note-taking, and reading emails.</li> <li> <p>Agent's involvement in chats with customers and the subsequent wrap-up process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agent Session Record</p> </li> </ul> <p>Description: Agent Session Records provide a comprehensive overview of an agent's work. They encompass a sequence of agent activities, offering insights into the agent's handling of tasks and interactions.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>An agent manages a service call, logging an incident or request.</li> <li>An agent initiates an outbound call and schedules a meeting for a customer.</li> <li>An agent engages in chat interactions with customers, providing answers and assistance.</li> <li>An agent reads and responds to customer emails, ensuring effective communication.</li> </ul> <p>These data repositories play a crucial role in capturing, organizing, and analysing the wealth of information generated within the Webex Contact Center, ultimately supporting informed decision-making and enhancing customer and agent experiences.</p> <p></p> <p>Before you continue with this exercise follow below:</p> <ol> <li>Make a Call and select prompted options to get to an agent, with no agent available you would hear a wait music.</li> <li>Make sure your agent is logged-in and currently in <code>Idle</code> state.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Labguide/ReportingExperience/#31-create-custom-realtime-agent-report","title":"3.1 Create Custom Realtime Agent Report","text":"<p>In this Lab, we will create a custom visualization to showcase the state of agents on a Realtime basis.</p> <p>Objective: Create an Agent Real-time state report with following data insights:</p> <ol> <li>State of Agents on real-time basis for Telephony channel.</li> <li> <p>Capture key metrics:</p> </li> <li> <p>Agent Team</p> </li> <li>Agent Name</li> <li>Agent State</li> <li>Idle Code</li> <li>Total number of agents logged-in</li> <li>Number of Agents in Available and idle state for each team</li> <li> <p>Duration in the State</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a high-level view, based on line of business (Group or Teams).</p> </li> <li>Have Data summarized based on each Line of Business (LOB).</li> <li>Have options to filter the data based on LOB and Idle code.</li> <li>Create some visual indication when certain agents in Idle state for long duration.</li> </ol> <p>While completing this Exercise, you will be able to understand and use some key capabilities like:</p> <ul> <li>Fields and Measures</li> <li>Enhanced Fields</li> <li>Formulas</li> <li>Drill-down</li> <li>Group Summary</li> <li>On the Fly-filter</li> <li> <p>Filtering</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a new visualization in Analyzer as an Agent Activity Record.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set Start Time as <code>Realtime</code>.</p> </li> <li>Set Duration as <code>None (Snapshot)</code>.</li> <li>Refresh duration as <code>3 Seconds</code>.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>Next, we will begin adding variables to the visualization.
