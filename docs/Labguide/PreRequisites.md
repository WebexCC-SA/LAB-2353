## Pre-Requisites

**Create Chrome Profiles**

- For the lab, create new Chrome profiles so that you can login the Administrators, Agents and Supervisors using the same Browser.

  - Select `Profiles` on Chrome
  - Select `Add Profile`
  - Select `continue without an account`
  - Give it a name .i.e `Admin`
  - Click `done`
  - Create 2 more profiles for `Supervisor` and `Agent`

![CH-Desktop-Call-In-Accepted](../../assets/images/agent/Chrome-Create-Profile.gif)

1. Ensure that you have received your tenant login credentials (Administrator, Supervisor and Agent) from the Lab proctors.
2. Make sure you are able to login into [Admin Portal](https://admin.webex.com) & [Analyzer](https://analyzer-v2.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/analyzer/home).
3. In this Lab, Part 1 and 2 already have historical data created to capture the key insights, hence no need to login Agent or make calls to complete those parts.
4. In Part 3, we will look into some Realtime data insights for which make sure you are logged-in with your Agent credentials

***You Will Need***

1. **One additional device** (like your personal phone) to test inbound calls to the Webex Contact Center. You can use your cell phone for this purpose.

   - Administrator credentials for the Control Hub: admin.webex.com.
   - Agent Login Credentials for the Agent Desktop: desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com.

2. The items listed below have been pre-configured for you:
   - Agent and Supervisor user accounts are configured and ready for login.
   - You can access the Agent Desktop via the URL: [https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com](https://desktop.wxcc-us1.cisco.com).
   - As an agent, you're associated with two teams —designated by your Attendee ID— as "Team1" and "Team2".

Example:

> If your attendee ID is 100:
>
> 100_Team1
>
> 100_Team2

1. Agents will use browsers for voice calls using WebRTC (Web Real-time Communication) endpoints. Additionally, Webex Calling extensions have been assigned to users (supervisors) to facilitate alternate device experiences.

2. A preset inbound Voice flow is available for test calls.

## Lab Configuration

!!! tip "Please submit the form below with your Attendee ID in 3 digits long format (e.g. if your attendee ID is 51, please enter 051) and click Save. All configuration items in the lab guide will be renamed with that prefix."

    <script>
    document.forms["attendee-form"][1].value = localStorage.getItem("attendeeID") || "Your Attendee ID"; 
    update();
    </script>
    <form id="attendee-form">
    <label for="attendee">Attendee ID:</label>
    <input type="text" id="attendee" name="attendee" onChange="update()" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 5px; border-radius: 4px; background-color: orange;"><br>
    <br>
    <button type="button" onclick="update()" style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer; font-size: 16px;">Save</button>
    </form>
    <script>
    document.forms["attendee-form"][1].value = localStorage.getItem("attendeeID") || "Your Attendee ID";
    update();
    </script>

The following Administration entities have been configured for you via [Webex Control Hub](https://admin.webex.com){:target="\_blank"}.
