    Due to the requirements and scope of this lab, we will not be setting up the surveys and the auto CSAT feature from start to finish. Instead, we will review the necessary steps for configuration and explore the existing setups and reports related to the auto CSAT feature.

## 5.1 What is Auto CSAT score?

Auto CSAT predicts post-interaction CSAT for all customers, enabling contact centers leverage every interaction for insights and decision making to maximize customer satisfaction and agent performance. This feature uses the operational metrics and customer & agent sentiments associated with your contact centre interaction to predict and assign a CSAT score for that interaction.

        ``` markdown
        - 180 days of historical CSAT records collected from existing surveys. 
        ```
