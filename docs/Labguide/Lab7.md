!!! info "README"

    In this lab, we will make a test call to check the post-call survey feature using a pre-configured voice flow. We'll complete the survey as customers and then review/download the survey results from the administration portal. The steps for configuring the actual survey flow are at the end of this section but are not required to for this lab.

<script>
    function update(){them = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("input")).reduce((acc, input) => ({...acc, [input.id + "_out"] : input.value}),{});
   Object.entries(them).forEach((entry) => {
    Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName(entry[0])).forEach((element,index) => 
    {
      console.log(document.getElementsByClassName(entry[0])[index].innerHTML); 
      document.getElementsByClassName(entry[0])[index].innerHTML = entry[1];
    })})

  event.preventDefault()
   if(document.forms["attendee-form"][1].value != "Your_Attendee_ID"){
    localStorage.setItem("attendeeID",document.forms["attendee-form"][1].value)
  }  
  }
</script>

## 7.1 Agent Login



!!! tip "Please submit the form below with your Attendee ID in 3 digits long format (e.g. if your attendee ID is 51, please enter 051) and click Save. All configuration items in the lab guide will be renamed with that prefix."

    <script>
    document.forms["attendee-form"][1].value = localStorage.getItem("attendeeID") || "Your Attendee ID"; 
    update();
    </script>
    <form id="attendee-form">
    <label for="attendee">Attendee ID:</label>
    <input type="text" id="attendee" name="attendee" onChange="update()" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 5px; border-radius: 4px; background-color: orange;"><br>
    <br>
    <button type="button" onclick="update()" style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer; font-size: 16px;">Save</button>
    </form>
    <script>
    document.forms["attendee-form"][1].value = localStorage.getItem("attendeeID") || "Your Attendee ID";
    update();
    </script>
