    Due to the requirements and scope of this lab, we will not be setting up new topic analtics collection. Instead, we will review the necessary steps for configuration and explore the existing topics and reports related to the feature.

The objective of this lab is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Topic Analytics in Webex Contact Center to help identify potential candidates for automation, and apply the insights gained to enable subsequent AI-powered automation processes. This involves exploring various Topics identified by the AI model, analyzing individual conversations to identify areas of Automation. In this lab you are tasked to identify the top two opportunities for automation and capture the essential information needed to create the automation workflow by reviewing the customer conversations.
